Software source code written entirely by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau staff, and by contractors who are developing software on behalf of CFPB, is by default a public domain work.

Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by CFPB staff is considered a "joint work" (see 17 USC ยง 101); it is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.
