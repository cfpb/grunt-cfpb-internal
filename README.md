# grunt-contrib-internal

> Internal tasks for managing the grunt-contrib project.

_Note that this plugin has not yet been released, and only works with the latest bleeding-edge, in-development version of grunt. See the [When will I be able to use in-development feature 'X'?](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/faq.md#when-will-i-be-able-to-use-in-development-feature-x) FAQ entry for more information._

## Getting Started
If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-internal --save-dev
```
