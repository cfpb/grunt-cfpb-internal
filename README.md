# grunt-cfpb-internal

> Internal grunt tasks for managing project documentation. Based on [grunt-contrib-internal](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-internal).

## Getting Started

1. [Install Node and Grunt](https://cfpb.ghe.url/contolini/grunt-init-cfpb#prerequisites)
1. `npm install git://cfpb.ghe.url/contolini/grunt-cfpb-internal.git --save-dev`

## Documentation

grunt-cfpb-internal will append your CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG and LICENSE files to your README.md. If these files are not in your project's root directory, they will be generated. CHANGELOG should be in YAML format and will be parsed accordingly.
