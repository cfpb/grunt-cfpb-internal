# grunt-cfpb-internal

Internal grunt task for automating project documentation and semantic versioning. Inspired by [grunt-contrib-internal](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-internal).

grunt-cfpb-internal does a few things:
* Creates [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines), `CHANGELOG` and [`LICENSE`](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/opensourceyourcode#applying-the-licence) files in your project's root if they don't already exist.
* Appends the aforementioned files to your `README.md` with a timestamp.
* Creates and pushes an [annotated git tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging#Annotated-Tags) using the [semver](http://semver.org/) convention.
* Bumps the version number in your package.json.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
1. `npm install grunt-cfpb-internal --save-dev`
1. Add `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cfpb-internal');` to your project's `Gruntfile.js`.

## Usage

1. Add a new entry in `CHANGELOG` whenever you fix bugs or add features. Adhere to the [semver](http://semver.org/) system.
1. Run the task with `grunt build-cfpb`.
