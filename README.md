# grunt-contrib-internal

> Internal tasks for managing the grunt-contrib project.

_Note that this plugin has not yet been released, and only works with the latest bleeding-edge, in-development version of grunt. See the [When will I be able to use in-development feature 'X'?](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/faq.md#when-will-i-be-able-to-use-in-development-feature-x) FAQ entry for more information._

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-contrib-internal --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-internal');
```

If the plugin has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list the newly-installed plugin's task or tasks. In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.

## The build-contrib task
